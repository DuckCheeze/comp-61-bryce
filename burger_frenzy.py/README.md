# Burger Flippin’ Frenzy is a fast-paced, arcade-style game where you flip hot burgers through the air and try to catch them on a moving plate before they hit the floor! With every successful flip, your score rises and the action gets wilder — all while chef corgi runs across the screen offering random encouragement (or judgment). It’s a silly, fun, and frantic challenge that’s easy to pick up and hard to put down. Perfect for casual gamers and burger enthusiasts alike, Burger Flippin’ Frenzy mixes light-hearted humor with reflex-based gameplay. The quirky animations, satisfying sound effects, and a countdown timer crank up the pressure, keeping players flipping until the very end.

# Gameplay loop:
# The player presses the spacebar to flip the burger, launching it into an arc through the air. Using the left and right arrow keys, the player moves the plate horizontally to catch the falling burger. If the burger lands on the plate, it bounces back up automatically and the score increases. If it misses, it splats — and the game ends. Each successful catch increases the player's streak, motivating them to stay in the frenzy and rack up a high score before the timer runs out.

# The core dynamics of the game:
# Burger Flipping – Launching the burger into a dynamic arc
# Catching – Controlling a plate to catch the falling burger
# Timed Challenge – The player competes against a countdown timer
# Score Tracking – Players gain points with each successful catch
# Animated Reactions – A corgi gives randomized, rotating messages throughout gameplay

# Progression
# The game uses a single, increasingly intense level where the challenge ramps up as the player tries to maintain their streak under time pressure. There are no multiple levels, but the tension builds naturally through increasing speed and the desire to beat the high score. The home screen shows your best performance to keep players coming back for “just one more flip.”

# W/L
# Win: There’s no traditional “win” condition — players succeed by achieving a high score before time runs out.   Loss: The game ends if the player drops the burger (misses the plate) or when the timer reaches zero. A game over screen displays the final score and encourages another try.
